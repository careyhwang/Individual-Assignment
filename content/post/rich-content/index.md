title: Ancient Chinese Literature
---

When I was in my fourth year of undergradute studies, I took a large number of literature courses at Fudan University, including ancient Chinese literature and modern Chinese literature.

Literature and history courses such as professor Luo Yuming’s *History of Ancient Chinese Literature* and professor's Jin Li's *Appreciation of Modern Chinese Literature* has aroused my great interest in Chinese literature, classical architecture, arts and crafts. I am always impressed by the works that carry the beauty of life and free creation of Chinese people, and I can't wait to put this creative passion into practice. I always hope that one day the stone will show its texture and so to feel its response to me.

This is my favorite course: *Appreciation of Classical Poetry* which tells the history of Chinese literature from *The Book of Songs*, the earliest anthologies of verse in china, to Tang Poetry and Song Ci.
